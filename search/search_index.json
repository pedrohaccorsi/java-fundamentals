Conclusion # The Java compilation and running process can be condensed by the image below, where we declare a Hello.java compile it with javac Hello.java run it with java Hello From it, we can understand why java is a write once, run anywhere language, since the actual conversion to machine code isn't made by the compiler itself, but by an entire runtime environemt (JRE) that is client-specific.","title":"Compiling and Running"},{"location":"beginer/java-big-picture/compile-run/readme/#compiling-and-running","text":"Consider the code below.

These three parts of the Java plataform are bundled together into the JDK: Java Development Kit . This means that the base architecture of a Java application consists in the following blocks: Aplication source code # The application source code is where we, developers, come in. We write our code with the java programming language . Here we apply the Java syntax to solve any given problem. Appication bytecode # With our code code, we now compile it into bytecode. This is an intermediary state of our code, which is yet not readable by the CPU. Here, our code is put together with 3 rd -party libraries we are using. Java Standard Edition (SE) APIs # Finally, Java adds the bytecode of the standard functions we are using, such as System.out or things like that. Once this is done, we finally have the bytecode of our entire application. Java Virtual Machine # Here is the final step. JVM is responsible to convert our bytecode application into CPU readable code (most likely assembly for a given processor architecture), which is then executed by the hardware. Conclusion # Java is a powerful language that bring apps to live due to is big environment. Also, it facilitates cross-plataform code, since developers compile any Java code into bytecode, that is latter processed by the user-specific JVM. In other words, Java is such a gigantic and commonly accepted plataform because developers can safely rely on stable 3 rd party libraries, stable JVM's to different processors, easy language ramp-up, along with many other points.","title":"Plataform"},{"location":"beginer/java-big-picture/plataform/readme/#plataform","text":"Java itself is composed by three big things: programming language runtime environment standard library When one refers to Java, they might be refering to either one of these three, or to the whole.
