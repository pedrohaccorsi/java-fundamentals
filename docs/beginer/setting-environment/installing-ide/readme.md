# Installing an IDE

=== "IntelliJ"

    My personal recomendation is IntelliJ Comunity. It is an IDE made specially for Java programming, and has a ton of built in funcionalities such as 

    - sending HTTP requests to your APIs
    - instant cyclomatic complexity analysis 
    - auto correct and auto predict
    - etc

    You can have it from [Jetbrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).


=== "Eclipse"

    Eclipse is also an extremely popular IDE for java programming. You can have it from [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
